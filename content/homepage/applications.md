[For over thirty years we have been assisting our clients in finding solutions to difficult analytical challenges using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Our instruments and software have gained a worldwide reputation for ruggedness, reliability and ease of use. They have proven their ability to perform the most demanding measurements under the harshest conditions. Here is just a sample of what our customers have achieved using our analyzers and the expertise of our applications scientists and specialists: ]: #
-   Extractive at-source and in-situ instrumentation
-   Complete turn-key process monitoring and emissions measurements
-    Open path monitoring, including fence-lines, flux, plumes, and incident areas
-    Moisture analysis of process gas streams including ammonia and other corrosives
-    Real time process monitoring and efficiency measurements in power plants
-    Stack testing and analysis of combustion byproducts including formaldehyde
-    Semiconductor and other industrial gas purity and usage analysis
-    Indoor facility air analysis and monitoring for workplace and safety compliance
-    Vehicle emissions and catalytic converter research
-    Natural gas vehicle and fuel cell R&D and quality control
-    Testing for EPA and ASTM protocol co	mpatibility
-    Feasibility and R&D studies
-    Chemical agent detection
-    Process control applications for manufacturing
-    Industrial hygiene measurements
