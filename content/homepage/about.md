There are seemingly no limits to where you can go with a MIDAC FTIR, our systems have been in use for more than thirty years in the harshest environments on the planet. Matching unmatched  resolution, and superior ruggedness, our systems are designed from the ground up to ensure that our systems 'just work'. 


[MIDAC Corporation was founded in 1978 with the goal of developing Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers for a broad spectrum of the scientific community - from research to industry. In pursuing this goal, the company has created a full line of FTIR products that are reliable, easy to use, and economical. The company's founder, Jerry Auth, brought a singular expertise in FTIR instrumentation to MIDAC. Jerry's work in the field began in 1965. Among other innovations, he pioneered the very first commercial FTIR instruments and refined them into specialized high resolution systems for the semiconductor industry. Our instruments and software have gained a worldwide reputation for ruggedness, reliability and ease of use. They have proven their ability to perform the most demanding measurements under the harshest conditions with an unmatched service life. ]: #

Among other innovations, his efforts include pioneering the very first commercial FTIR instruments and the subsequent refining of specialized high resolution systems for the semiconductor industry.Recognizing the widespread need for economical and reliable instrumentation throughout the chemical industry, MIDAC introduced its first line of rugged, low-cost spectrometers in 1988. With innovations including monocoque construction, a compact and durable interferometer, and the use of a standard personal computer based data system, the MIDAC system was the first to make the analytical power of FTIR available to the average chemist.The current family of MIDAC products incorporates next-generation advancements in hardware and software specifically designed for high performance gas phase analysis.  This includes a variety of application-specific solutions for industries including specialty gases, semiconductors, industrial hygiene, environmental, automotive, and general laboratory applications. ]: #
