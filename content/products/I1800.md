The I1800 line of FTIR spectrometers is the go-to for reliable on-line process monitoring. A rugged aluminum chassis houses the electronics, detector and interferometer module, and can be paired to any of the meter-length gas cells to ensure 24/7 process gas monitoring, preventing contamination issues and keeping your production running as it should be.
